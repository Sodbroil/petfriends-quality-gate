| **Module** | `All modules` |
| **Status** | `Under Review` |

## 🎯 Problem Description
Currently, when users perform actions (login, add pet, delete pet), there is minimal visual feedback. Buttons don't show loading states, and users are unsure if their action is being processed.

## 📝 Current Behavior
- Clicking buttons provides no immediate feedback
- Users sometimes click multiple times thinking it didn't work
- No visual indication of background processes

## 💡 Suggested Improvement
1. **Add loading spinners** to buttons during API calls
2. **Disable buttons** while action is in progress
3. **Add progress indicators** for longer operations
4. **Skeleton screens** for content loading

## 🎨 Visual Examples
- **Button loading state:** Button changes to "Processing..." with spinner
- **Form submission:** Whole form shows loading overlay
- **Content loading:** Skeleton cards while pets list loads

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- **User Experience:** High improvement
- **Development Effort:** Low (2-3 days)
- **Business Value:** Reduced user frustration, fewer duplicate actions

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- Buttons show loading state during API calls
- Buttons are disabled during processing
- Users receive clear feedback that action is in progress
- Loading states are consistent across all modules

## 🔗 Related Issues
- Users reporting "double submissions" causing duplicate pets
- Support tickets about "nothing happening" when clicking buttons
